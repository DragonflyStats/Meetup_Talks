### F Test for Equality of Variance

*  In this procedure, we determine whether or not two ***populations*** have the same variance.
*  The assumption of equal variance of two populations underpins several inference procedures. This assumption is tested by comparing the variance of samples taken from both populations.

#### Hypotheses
*  The null and alternative hypotheses are as follows:
	\[ H_0: \sigma^2_1 = \sigma^2_2 \]
	\[ H_1: \sigma^2_1 \neq \sigma^2_2 \]


	\begin{verbatim}
	> var.test(X,Y)
	
	F test to compare two variances
	
	data:  X and Y
	F = 2.5122, num df = 9, denom df = 9, p-value = 0.1862
	alternative hypothesis: true ratio of variances
	is not equal to 1
	95 percent confidence interval:
	0.6239986 10.1141624
	sample estimates:
	ratio of variances 
	2.512215
