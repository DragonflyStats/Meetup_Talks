### F-test of equality of variances

The test statistic is

\begin{equation} 
F = \frac{S_X^2}{S_Y^2}
\end{equation}

has an F-distribution with $n-1$ and $m-1$ degrees of freedom if the null hypothesis of equality of variances is true.

# var.test 	
# Performs an F test to compare the variances of two samples from normal populations.

x <- rnorm(50, mean = 0, sd = 2)
y <- rnorm(30, mean = 1, sd = 1)
var.test(x, y)
