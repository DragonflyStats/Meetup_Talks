#### Using Other \textit{Psi} Operators}

Fitting is done by \textbf{\emph{iterated re-weighted least squares (IWLS).}}

Psi functions are supplied for the Huber, Hampel and Tukey bisquare proposals as psi.huber, \texttt{psi.hampel} and \textbf{psi.bisquare}. 
Huber's corresponds to a convex optimization problem and gives a unique solution (up to collinearity). The other two will have multiple local minima, and a good starting point is desirable.
