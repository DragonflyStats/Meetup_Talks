### Outliers, leverage and influence
* An outlier may be defined as a data point that differs significantly from other observations.

* A high-leverage point are observations made at extreme values of independent variables.

* Both types of atypical observations will force the regression line to be close to the point.

### Influential observations

* An influential observation is an observation for a statistical calculation whose deletion from the dataset would noticeably change the result of the calculation.

* Equivalently, an influential observation is one whose deletion has a large effect on the parameter estimates in a regression analysis


### Metrics

* The DFBETAS are statistics that indicate the effect that deleting each observation has on the estimates for the regression coefficients. 

* The DFFITS and Cook's D statistics indicate the effect that deleting each observation has on the predicted values of the model.

* {broom} R package
