Model Assumptions
==========================
The Distribution of Dependent Variables

*  The assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance for linear models are not about Y, the dependent variable.  

*  The distributional assumptions for linear regression and ANOVA are for the distribution of $Y|X$ â€” (Y given X).  

*  The distribution of Y|X is, by definition, the same as the distribution of the residuals. Hence we can check validity by looking at the residuals.  


What are those distributional assumptions of $Y|X$?


1.  Independence
2.  Normality
3.  Constant Variance

#### Examining the Residual Plots

Recall: 

* The mean value of the residuals is zero,
* The variance of residuals are constant across the range of measurements,
* The residuals are normally distributed,
* Residuals are independent.


---

A residual plot is obtained by plotting the residuals e with respect to the independent variable X or,
alternatively with respect to the fitted regression line values $\hat{Y}$. Such a plot can be used to
investigate whether the assumptions concerning the residuals appear to be satisfied.

#### Asummption of Constant Variance

* Homoscedascity (also known as constant variance) is one of the assumptions required in a
regression analysis in order to make valid statistical inferences about population relationships.

* Homoscedasticity requires that the variance of the residuals are constant for all fitted values,
indicated by a uniform scatter or dispersion of data points about the trend line (i.e. "The Zero Line").
* From the above plot, we can conclude that the constant variance assumption is valid. We can also
see that the mean value of the residuals is close to zero. \textit{(Theoretically it is precisely zero)}.
