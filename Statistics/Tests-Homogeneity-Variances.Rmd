### Bartlett Test of Homogeneity of Variances

Performs Bartlett's test of the null that the variances in each of the groups (samples) are the same.

```{r}
plot(count ~ spray, data = InsectSprays,
     horizontal=TRUE,
     pch=18,col=c("pink","lightblue","lightgreen"))
```

```{r}
bartlett.test(InsectSprays$count, InsectSprays$spray)

```

```{r}
bartlett.test(count ~ spray, data = InsectSprays)
```

### Fligner-Killeen Test of Homogeneity of Variances


* The Fligner Killeen test is a non-parametric test for homogeneity of group variances based on ranks. 

* It is useful when the data is non-normal or where there are outliers.

* Test of the null that the variances in each of the groups (samples) are the same.

```{r}
fligner.test(InsectSprays$count, InsectSprays$spray)
```

```{r}
fligner.test(count ~ spray, data = InsectSprays)
```
