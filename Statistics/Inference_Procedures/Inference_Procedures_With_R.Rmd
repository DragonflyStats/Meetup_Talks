### Statistical Inference

*  $R$ commands for statistical inference procedures * 
t.test() - testing procedure for means.

*  One sample *  Two sample *  Paired

*  prop.test() - testing procedure for proportions.

*  One sample *  Two sample

*  var.test() - testing procedure for variances.

### {Single sample inference}

If we have a single sample we might want to answer several
questions:

*  What is the mean value? *  Is the mean value
significantly different from current theory? (Hypothesis test)
*  What is the level of uncertainty associated with our
estimate of the mean value? (Confidence interval)

To ensure that our analysis is correct we need to check for
outliers in the data (i.e. boxplots) and we also need to check
whether the data are normally distributed or not.
