### Functions

**Defining Functions:**

```R
myfct <- function(arg1, arg2, ...) {
  # function_body
}
```

The value returned by a function is the value of the function body, which is usually an unassigned final expression, e.g., `return()`.

**Calling Functions:**

```R
myfct(arg1 = ..., arg2 = ...)
```

### Time and Date

It is useful to check the length of time a program takes to run.

```R
date() # returns the current system date and time
```
