#### Probability Distributions in R
- Standard probability distributions have short names in R.
- Probability functions names consist of two parts: the function name (e.g., `d`, `p`, `q`, `r`) and the distribution name (e.g., `norm`, `exp`).
  Example:
  ```R
  # A sample of size 10 from an exponential distribution with mean 3
  rexp(10, 1/3)
  ```
