### Installed Data Sets

To assist in the demonstration of statistical methodologies, several embedded data sets are installed automatically with R. To view the list of available data sets, type `data()` in the command line. One frequently used data set is the Iris data set.

```R
# Accessing built-in data sets
data()
iris

# View first and last six cases
head(iris)
tail(iris)
```

### Resident Data Sets

The following are some data sets that come as part of the basic R installation. We will be using them frequently in the course:
- `iris`
- `mtcars`
- `ChickWeights`
- `airquality`

For more information on each, use the `help()` command, e.g., `help(iris)`.
