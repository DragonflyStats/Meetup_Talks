The R Programming Language is a statistical and data analysis tool. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

## Vector Types

**R** operates on named data structures. The simplest such structure is the vector, which is a single entity consisting of an ordered collection of numbers or characters.

### Types of Vectors

- Numeric vectors
- Character vectors
- Logical vectors
- Complex number vectors
- Colour vectors

### Creating Vectors

To create a vector, use the assignment operator and the concatenate function. For numeric vectors, the values are simply numbers.

```R
# week8.r
NumVec <- c(10.4, 5.6, 3.1, 6.4)
```

Alternatively, we can use the `assign()` command. For character vectors, the values are simply characters specified with quotation marks. A logical vector is a vector whose elements are `TRUE`, `FALSE`, or `NA`.

```R
CharVec <- c("blue", "green", "yellow")
LogVec <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
```

Another method of creating vectors is to use the following:

```R
numeric(length = n)
character(length = n)
logical(length = n)
```

These commands create empty vectors of the appropriate kind, of length `n`. You can then use the graphical data entry interface to populate your data sets.

### Accessing Elements of a Vector

The `n`-th element of vector `Vec` can be accessed by specifying its index when calling `Vec`.

```R
Vec[n]
```

A sequence of elements of vector `Vec` can be accessed by specifying its index when calling `Vec`.

```R
Vec[l:u]
```

Omitting and deleting the `n`-th element of vector `Vec`:

```R
Vec[-n]
Vec <- Vec[-n]
```

## Inputting Data

Concatenation.

## Using Help

```R
?mean
```

## Packages

The capabilities of R are extended through user-submitted packages, which allow specialized statistical techniques, graphical devices, and import/export capabilities to many external data formats.




### Miscellaneous

`seq()` and `rep()` are useful commands for constructing vectors with a certain pattern.

## Probability Distributions

### Generating a Set of Random Numbers

```R
rnorm(10)
```



```R
framename = data.frame()
```

## Probability Distributions

### The Discrete Uniform Distribution

- Parameters: `min`, `max`.
- The default values are `0` and `1`.

## Descriptive Statistics and Basic Graphical Methods

### Measures of Centrality and Dispersion

```R
sd(X)
```

### Vector Types

R operates on named data structures. The simplest such structure is the vector, which is a single entity consisting of an ordered collection of numbers or characters.

#### Numeric Vectors
- Created using the assignment operator and the concatenate function.
```R
# Numeric vector
NumVec <- c(10.4, 5.6, 3.1, 6.4)
```

#### Character Vectors
- Values are characters, specified with quotation marks.
```R
# Character vector
CharVec <- c("blue", "green", "yellow")
```

#### Logical Vectors
- Elements are TRUE, FALSE, or NA.
```R
# Logical vector
LogVec <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
```

You can also use the `assign()` command to create vectors.

 5 Data Creation, Data Entry, Data Import and Export
 
 %==============================================================================================%
 
 \frametitle{5.1 The \texttt{c()} command}
 To create a simple data set, known as a vector, we use the c() command to create the vector.
 \begin{framed}
 \begin{semiverbatim}
 > Y=c(1,2,4,8,16 ) #create a data vector with specified elements
 > Y
 [1] 1 2 4 8 16
 
 \end{semiverbatim}
 \end{framed}
 
 
 %==============================================================================================%
 
 \frametitle{Vectors}
 \begin{framed}
 \begin{semiverbatim}
 ### Vector of Numeric Values
 Numvec = c(10,13,15,19,25);
 ## Vector of Character Values
 Charvec = c("LouLou","Oscar","Rasher");
 
 ## Vector of Logical Values
 Charvec = c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE);
 \end{semiverbatim}
 \end{framed}
 
 %==============================================================================================%
 
 \frametitle{Vectors}
 Vectors can be bound together either by row or by column.
 \begin{framed}
 \begin{semiverbatim}
 > X=1:3; Y=4:6
 > cbind(X,Y)
 X Y
 [1,] 1 4
 [2,] 2 5
 [3,] 3 6
 >
 > rbind(X,Y)
 [,1] [,2] [,3]
 X 1 2 3
 Y 4 5 6
 \end{semiverbatim}
 \end{framed}
 
 %==============================================================================================%
 
 \frametitle{5.2 The scan() command}
 \begin{itemize}
 \itemThe \texttt{scan()} function is a useful method of inputting data quickly. 
 \item You can use to quickly copy
 and paste values into the \texttt{R} environment. It is best used in the manner as described in the
 following example. 
 \item Create a variable ”X” and use the \texttt{scan()} function to populate it with
 values. 
 \item Type in a value, and then press return. Once you have entered all the values, press
 return again to return to normal operation.
 \end{itemize}
 
 %==============================================================================================%
 
 \begin{semiverbatim}
 > X=scan()
 1: 4
 2: 5
 3: 5
 4: 6
 5:
 Read 4 items
 \end{semiverbatim}
 Remark: Try the \texttt{edit()} command on object X.
 
 %==============================================================================================%
 
 5.2.1 Characters with the scan() command
 The scan() command can also be used forinputting character data.
 > Y=scan(what=" ")
 1: LouLou
 2: Oscar
 3: Rasher
 4:
 Read 3 items
 > Y
 [1] "LouLou" "Oscar" "Rasher"
 
 %==============================================================================================%
 
 5.3 Using the data editor
 
 
 %==============================================================================================%
 
 5.4 Spreadsheet Interface
 R provides a spreadsheet interface for editing the values of existing data sets. We use the
 command \texttt{data.entry()}, and name of the data object as the argument. (Also try out the
 fix() command)
 \begin{framed}
 \begin{semiverbatim}
 > data.entry(X) # Edit the data set and exit interface
 > X
 \end{semiverbatim}
 \end{framed}
