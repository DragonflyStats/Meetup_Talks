Alright! Here is the streamlined and organized content without duplication:

---

## Command Line and Comments

- The command line interface.
- Comments are added to code using the hash sign `#`.

```r
x = 2  # x equals two
y = 4  # y equals four
x * y  # x multiplied by y
```



---

## Other Mathematical Functions

### Complex Numbers

```R
x = -1 ;  sqrt(x)  ;  str(x) ;  # variable is defined as numeric, not complex.
y = -1 + 0i ;  sqrt(y)  ;  str(y) ;  # variable is defined as complex.
```

### Trigonometric Functions

```R
pi  # returns the value of pi to six decimal places
sin(3.5 * pi)  # correct answer is -1
cos(3.5 * pi)  # correct answer is zero
```

### Useful R Commands for Linear Algebra

```R
var(Mat1[,1])  # determine the variance of the first column
var(Mat1[,2])  # determine the variance of the second column
var(Mat1[3,])  # determine the variance of the third row
cov(Mat1[,1], Mat1[,2])  # covariance of the first two columns
var(Mat1)  # variance-covariance matrix of all columns
VCmat = var(Mat1)  # Save as matrix “VCmat”
cor(Mat1)  # correlation matrix of all columns
cov2cor(VCmat)  # convert a VC matrix to a correlation matrix
```

### seq() and rep()

Provide convenient ways to construct vectors with a certain pattern.

```R
seq(10)
[1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
seq(0, 1, length = 10)
[1] 0.0000000 0.1111111 0.2222222 0.3333333 0.4444444 0.5555556 0.6666667 0.7777778 0.8888889 1.0000000
seq(0, 1, by = 0.1)
[1] 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0
rep(1, 3)
[1] 1 1 1
c(rep(1, 3), rep(2, 2), rep(-1, 4))
[1]  1  1  1  2  2 -1 -1 -1 -1
rep("Small", 3)
[1] "Small" "Small" "Small"
c(rep("Small", 3), rep("Medium", 4))
[1] "Small"  "Small"  "Small"  "Medium" "Medium" "Medium" "Medium"
rep(c("Low", "High"), 3)
[1] "Low"  "High" "Low"  "High" "Low"  "High"
```

### Set Theory Operations

Operations related to sets in R.

### Controlling Precision and Integerization

```R
pi
round(pi, 3)
round(pi, 2)
floor(pi)
ceiling(pi)
```

---

### Important Introductory Topics

#### The `head()` and `tail()` Functions
- These functions are used to view the first and last parts of a data set, respectively.

#### Randomly Generated Numbers
- With \(a\) and \(b\) as the lower and upper bounds of the continuous uniform distribution.
\[X \sim U(a,b)\]

Feel free to ask if you need more details or examples on any of these topics!

## Generating Sequences

R has a number of ways to generate sequences of numbers. These include the simplest approach, using the colon `":"`.

```R
1:10
# Output: [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

---

## Managing Precision

- `floor()`
- `ceiling()`
- `round()`
- `as.integer()`

```R
pi
# [1] 3.141593

floor(pi)
# [1] 3

ceiling(pi)
# [1] 4

round(pi, 3)
# [1] 3.142

as.integer(pi)
# [1] 3
```

---

## Vectors

R handles vector objects quite easily and intuitively.

```R
x <- c(1, 3, 2, 10, 5)  # create a vector x with 5 components
x
# [1] 1 3 2 10 5

y <- 1:5                # create a vector of consecutive integers
y
# [1] 1 2 3 4 5

y + 2                   # scalar addition
# [1] 3 4 5 6 7

2 * y                   # scalar multiplication
# [1] 2 4 6 8 10

y^2                     # raise each component to the second power
# [1] 1 4 9 16 25

2^y                     # raise 2 to the first through fifth power
# [1] 2 4 8 16 32

y                       # y itself has not been changed
# [1] 1 2 3 4 5

y <- y * 2              # it is now changed
y
# [1] 2 4 6 8 10
```

### Miscellaneous

`seq()` and `rep()` are useful commands for constructing vectors with a certain pattern.
