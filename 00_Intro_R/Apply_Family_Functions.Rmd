### The Apply Family

Sometimes, you may want to apply a function to each element of a vector/data frame/list/array. There are four main members in the Apply family:

1. **`lapply`:** Takes any structure and returns a list of results (hence the 'l').

2. **`sapply`:** Similar to `lapply`, but tries to simplify the result to a vector or matrix if possible (hence the 's').

3. **`apply`:** Only used for arrays/matrices.

4. **`tapply`:** Creates tables (hence the 't') of values from subgroups defined by one or more factors.
