## The `summary()` Command

`summary()` is a generic but very useful function to summarize many types of R objects, including datasets. 
When used on a dataset, `summary` returns distributional summaries of variables in the dataset.

#### Basic Statistics in R
- Summary statistics of a data set can be obtained from `summary()`, or by using individual commands like `mean()`, `sd()`, `mad()`, and `IQR()`.
- Standard hypothesis tests are also available, e.g., `t.test()` yields the standard tests for means of one or two normal samples.
