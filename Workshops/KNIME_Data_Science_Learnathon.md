## KNIME Learnathon

### What is a Learnathon?

It's between a hackathon and a workshop. It's like a workshop because we'll learn more about the data science cycle - data access, data blending, data preparation, model training, optimization, testing, and deployment. It's like a hackathon because we'll work in groups to hack a workflow-based solution to guided exercises.

The tool of choice for this learnathon is KNIME Analytics Platform - an open, open-source, GUI driven, data analytics platform, that covers all your data needs from data import to final deployment. Being open, KNIME offers a vast integration and IDE environment for R, Python, SQL, and Spark.

After an initial introduction to the tool and to the data science cycle, we'll split in to groups. Each group will focus on one of three aspects of the data science cycle:

  *  Group 1 - Working on the raw data. Data access and data preparation.

  *  Group 2 - Machine Learning. Which model shall I use? Which parameters?

   * Group 3 - I have a great model. Now what? The model deployment phase.

Please also download the workshop material (jump-start workflows and instructions) from here. We'll import this material during the learnathon.
