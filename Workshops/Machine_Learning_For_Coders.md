## Machine Learning for Coders

Presented: Iain Keaney (skellig.ai)

#### Abstract

* Machine Learning (ML) is no longer ring fenced to researchers and data scientists.

* New high-level APIs are driving the democratisation of ML applications and enabling programmers to build and implement ML solutions in their own work. 

* This workshop describes how these APIs work and why they sometimes perform better than even state-of-the-art solutions.

#### Time and Location

* The workshop takes place on Saturday 1st February at Thomond Park.

* The workshop will take place on Morning Session (11:00 to 13:00) in a workshop room at Career Zoo.

* The venue is ordinarily a corporate box suite, and has a capacity of 12 people.

#### Requirement

* Please bring a fully charged laptop.

As a creative engineer, I love to build new things. I’ve previously worked on a computer vision start-up, developing a consumer solution for mobile 3D scanning. My PhD focused on an  application of artificial intelligence in offshore engineering.

In 2017 I was named in The Sunday Business Post’s 30 Under 30 Most Interesting People in Irish Tech.
