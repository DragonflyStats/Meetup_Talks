I was wondering if you have time to look at some of the minutes of the following meetings as you know myself and Stephen Kell are involved in Multiple open source data Communities myself and function retiring from most of the roles but it's very important to keep institutional memory. that we made is that has a lot of duplication of work and anything that can help mitigate this is beneficial everybody.

hi Liam rcall, I suggested that are my New York in March 2024 due to conflicting event I decided I might go sooner i.e. Late February 2024. I'm wondering I think about this as a suitable time. There are a couple of things I would like to do. I would like to go to the Google home again because I'm still remember I would like to go to the Whitney again because I've also still remember I would like to go to studio 54 and see the whiffenpoofs performance.
