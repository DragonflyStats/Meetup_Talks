Tutorial

\begin{enumerate}
\item During the day, cars pass along a point on a remote road at an average rate of one per 20 minutes. Calculate the probability that 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item The time between the arrival of 2 cars is greater than 1 hour.
\item The time between the arrival of 2 cars is less than 10 minutes 
\itemThe time between the arrival of 2 cars is greater than 20 minutes, but less than 40 minutes. 

\end{enumerate}



\subsection*{Question 5}
Let $X \sim \text{Normal}(\mu=10,\sigma=2)$. Calculate the following:\\[-0.2cm]

{\bf(a)} $\Pr(X>10)$. 
 \item  $\Pr(X<3)$. 
 \item  $\Pr(X>8.4)$. 
 \item  $\Pr(6<X<14)$. 
 \item  The value of $x$ such that $\Pr(X>x)$ = 0.3. 
 \item  The value of $x$ such that $\Pr(X>x)$ = 0.8.



\subsection*{Question 6}
Assume that speeds of cars on a motorway have a normal distribution with mean 115km/hr and standard deviation 4km/hr.\\[-0.2cm]

{\bf(a)} Draw a rough sketch of the distribution. 
 \item  $\Pr(X>120)=$ ? 
 \item  $\Pr(X<100)=$ ? 
 \item  $\Pr(100<X<110)=$ ? 
 \item  1\% of drivers travel above what speed?
