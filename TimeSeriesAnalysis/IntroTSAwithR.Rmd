Time Series and Forecasting
=============================
R has extensive facilities for analyzing time series data. This section describes the creation of a time series, seasonal decompostion, modeling with exponential and ARIMA models, and forecasting with the forecast package.


```R
library(forecast)
```



#### Creating a time series
The `ts()` function will convert a numeric vector into an R time series object. 
The format is `ts(vector, start=, end=, frequency=)` where `start` and `end` 
are the times of the first and last observation and frequency is the number of observations 
per unit time (1=annual, 4=quartly, 12=monthly, etc.).






```R
# save a numeric vector containing 72 monthly observations
# from Jan 2009 to Dec 2014 as a time series object
myvector <- sort(rnorm(72,100,4)) + rnorm(72,5,1)
myts <- ts(myvector, start=c(2009, 1), end=c(2014, 12), frequency=12) 

# subset the time series (June 2014 to December 2014)
myts2 <- window(myts, start=c(2014, 6), end=c(2014, 12)) 

# plot series
plot(myts)

```

#### Seasonal Decomposition
A time series with additive trend, seasonal, and irregular components can be decomposed using the stl() function. 
Note that a series with multiplicative effects can often by transformed into series with additive effects through a log transformation (i.e., newts &lt;- log(myts)).



```R
# Seasonal decomposition
fit <- stl(myts, s.window="period")
plot(fit)


```

```R
# additional plots
monthplot(myts)
library(forecast)
seasonplot(myts)
```

#### Exponential Models
Both the HoltWinters() function in the base installation, and the ets() function in the forecast package, can be used to fit exponential models.




```R
# simple exponential - models level
fit <- HoltWinters(myts, beta=FALSE, gamma=FALSE)
# double exponential - models level and trend
fit <- HoltWinters(myts, gamma=FALSE)
# triple exponential - models level, trend, and seasonal components
fit <- HoltWinters(myts)


```


```R
# predictive accuracy
library(forecast)
accuracy(fit)

# predict next three future values
library(forecast)
forecast(fit, 3)
plot(forecast(fit, 3))
```


    Error in accuracy(fit): First argument should be a forecast object or a time series.
    Traceback:


    1. accuracy(fit)

    2. stop("First argument should be a forecast object or a time series.")
