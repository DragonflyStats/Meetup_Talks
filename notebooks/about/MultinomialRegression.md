Multinomial Regression 
==========================
Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) is a form of linear regression analysis conducted when the dependent variable is nominal 
with more than two levels. It is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent nominal variable 
and one or more continuous-level (interval or ratio scale) independent variables. You can understand nominal variable as, a 
variable which has no intrinsic ordering.

For example: Types of Forests: ‘Evergreen Forest’, ‘Deciduous Forest’, ‘Rain Forest’. 

As you see, there is no intrinsic order in them, but each forest represent a unique category. 
In other words, multinomial regression is an extension of logistic regression, which analyzes dichotomous (binary) dependents.
