### Survival Analysis

#### Workshop Overview:
The series of videos focuses on survival analysis, a statistical approach to analyze time-to-event data. 

#### Key Topics Covered:
1. **Basic Concepts**:
   - Survival analysis examines the distribution of times for events to occur.
   - The focus is on estimating survival and hazard functions.

2. **Workshop Materials**:
   - Resources are available on GitHub.
   - The workshop uses the book "Applied Survival Analysis Using R" by Dirk F. Moore.

3. **Example Datasets**:
   - Telco Churn Data: Customer usage information and subscription churn.
   - Prostate Survival Data: Cancer survival study.
   - Smoker Data: Smoking relapse study with different treatments.

4. **Basic Principles**:
   - Data Censoring and Truncation: Handling incomplete observations (right-censored, left-censored data).
   - Hazard and Survival Functions: Defining survival distribution, survival function ($S(t)$), and hazard function ($\lambda(t)$).
   - Cumulative Functions: Using cumulative hazard function ($\Lambda(t)$) for survival estimation.
   - Mean and Median Survival: Calculating expected and median survival times.

5. **Example Distributions**:
   - Different hazard scenarios (constant, early, late hazard) are explored using R plots.

6. **Estimations of the Survival Functions**:
   - Kaplan-Meier Estimator: Standard method to estimate survival function.
   - Practical application using Râ€™s `survfit()` function and visualizations with the `survminer` package.

#### Practical Implementation:
The workshop provides practical examples using R code to demonstrate survival analysis concepts, data handling, and visualizations.
