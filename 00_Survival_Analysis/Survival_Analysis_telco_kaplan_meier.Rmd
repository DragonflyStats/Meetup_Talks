### Survival Analysis


Here we will apply Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimators and smoothed hazard functions to the telco data set.

### Key Exercises

1. **Kaplan-Meier Estimator for Telco Churn Data**:
    - Construct the KM estimator for the telco churn data.
    - Find the median and mean survival times for this data.
    - Repeat these steps for the prostate survival and smoker data.

2. **Follow-Up Time Measurement**:
    - Measure the follow-up time by reversing the censoring labels in the dataset.

3. **Smoothed Hazard Functions**:
    - Construct smoothed hazard estimators for the telco churn data.
    - Determine the times with the highest and lowest hazard rates.
    - Repeat these steps for the prostate survival and smoker data.

4. **Boundary Corrections**:
    - Explore boundary corrections in smoothed hazard functions using the `muhaz()` function.

5. **Comparing KM and Smoothed Estimates**:
    - Compare the Kaplan-Meier estimates and smoothed hazard estimates by integrating the hazard function to calculate the survival function.
    - Evaluate the differences with and without boundary corrections.

6. **Estimating Survival Curves for Telco Churn Data**:
    - Build KM estimates for the telco churn data and splits based on `vmailplan` and `intlplan`.
    - Plot the survival curves and analyze differences using confidence bounds.

7. **Combining KM Estimators**:
    - Stack KM estimator data for combined visualization.
    - Simplify and compare curves for different subgroups to identify patterns and insights.

### Next Steps

Participants can further explore the practical application of these survival analysis techniques to gain deeper insights into their datasets. 
These exercises provide a comprehensive understanding of survival analysis, from basic concepts to advanced estimations and visualizations.
