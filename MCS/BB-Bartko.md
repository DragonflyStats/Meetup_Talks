Blackwood & Bradley (1988, 1991) and Bartko 1994
==============================================
- The Bradley Blackwood procedure is a simultaneous test for equality of the variance and mean of a pair of data sets. 
- A linear regression is fitted according to the sums and differences. 
- The Bradley-Blackwood procedure tests whether  the regression coefficients in the regression of the pair wise case-wise difference (X1-X2) versus the case-wise averages ((X1+X2)/2) 
are significantly different from zero.
- The null hypothesis is that mean and variance of both methods equal.
- The test statistic is provided in \BB89, and the critical value is an F value at \alpha \% significance, with degrees of freedom 2 and n-2,  where n is the number of paired values.
- This approach was amended by Bartko 1994 to be uses in the Method comparison study.
- It is noticeably a simultaneous test for bias and precision.
