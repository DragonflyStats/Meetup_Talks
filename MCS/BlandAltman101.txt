Case Study 1 : Carstensens "Fat" Data set
The two methods are labelled KL and SL
BXC computed the inter-method bias as 0.044883.
The standard residual was
0.077174 for method KL ( variance : 0.005955826)
0.072417 for method SL ( variance : 0.005244222)
The interaction SD was 0.059556 ( variance : 0.003546917)
BXC computed the limits of agreement as  (-0.23,0.32).

### 1.1 Method Comparison Studies
This is a branch of statistics used to compare the results of two different method of measurement, measuring the same subject samples.
Consider a set of n samples. Measurements are taken on each of the n samples using both methods. This will enable comparison of the method used.
 
In many cases the purpose of the study is to calibrate a new method of measurement against a ‘Gold Standard’ method. A ‘Gold Standard’ method is the known method that is considered most precise in its measurement. It should not be assumed that there is no error present in its measurements.
 
The Gold Standard may not be financially feasible for general use, and therefore more economical methods, of suitable levels of precisions, must be devised.
Method Comparison studies is used to ascertain the levels of precision of such methods.

1.2 Reasons for the Introduction of the Bland Altman Plot
 
The Bland Altman Plot was proposed to replace the previous convention of using Pearsons. Inappropriate use of correlation coefficient (r)
 
(1)   r measures the strength in relationship between two variables, but not the level of agreement between them.
 
For agreement to take place - the two variables must be correlated along the line of equality (i.e. the mean difference line). Two variables may be highly correlated if they are
 
“It is obvious to us that this method (Pearson’s correlation coefficient) does not assess agreement, but association”
 Bland & Altman (Clinical Chemistry 48, No.5 2002)
 
“The question is not whether the two methods agree, but how closely they agree”
Bland & Altman (Clinical Chemistry 48, No.5 2002)
 
 
### 1.3 What is Agreement
 
Bland and Altman [1996/7] define perfect agreement as the case where all pairs of rater data lie along the line of equality, where the line of equality is defined as the 45˚ line passing the origin ``
 
### 1.4 Criticism of the Bland Altman Plot
 
1.4.1 Suboptimal Usage
 
“They (Dewitte et al) have found that some authors are not making the best use of the method ”
Bland & Altman (Clinical Chemistry 48, No.5 2002)
 
1.4.2 The potential of Range of Differences to be inappropriate
 
“The only criticism that has been levelled against the Bland and Altman method is that it depends on an expert to make a judgement whether the range of differences evident in their analysis is acceptable or not”
Daniel, Ziace et al (The journal of Bone and Joint Surgery Vol 89-B, no.6, June 2007)[5]
 
In the Study cited by Daniel et al, they found that the Lines of Agreement, and the disagreement calculation (i.e when comparing metal ions) yielded results too wide to be acceptable.
 
2 Construction of a Bland Altman Plot
Firstly we remind ourselves that a set of measurements was taken on n samples using two different methods, X and Y. This yields 2n measurements.

Bland Altmans approach is to calculate
1.      The difference of each pair of measurements (i.e. Xj-Yj)
2.      The Average of each pair of measurements (i.e. [Xj+Yj]/2)
 
( with  j from 1 to n)
 
Bland and Altman specify that the first step that should be taken is to plot these differences against the corresponding averages. An example of such a graph is shown in figure.1

2.2 95% Limits of Agreement 
This is a range of differences, based on the mean difference ( ) and the standard deviation of those differences (s) i.e.
 
 
 
Section 3 – Refining the Bland Altman Plot
 
An initial inspection of the Bland Altman Plot may reveal unsatisfactory results.
In this section we look at these possible outcomes and propose how to get a more useful plot.

#### 3.2 Magnitude Dependency
 
It may be found that the standard deviation increases along the x-axis.
In this case the variation of the method depends strongly on the magnitude of measurements. Bland and Altman recommend a logarithmic y scale [3]

4 Questions that arise when using the Bland Altman Plot
           
4.1 Should Outliers be omitted?
Bland & Altman do not recommend the omission of outliers. However they do suggest that it would be a useful exercise to recalculate WHAT? without the outliers, and then compare values so as to assess the influence of those outliers.
 
4.2 Different units of measurement?
 
It is possible when using different units of measurement (for example µg/l, nmol/l etc) it is possible to plot the differences a percentage of means as well [5]
 
4.3 Non Uniform differences
 
 

 
6. Eksborg’s Proposal
 
Staffan Eksborg proposed the comparison of the relative values (i.e. method1 /  method 2) to the mean values. [8]
 
He argues that plotting of one method against another is insufficient, on the basis that deviations in the lower part of the range are difficult to detect.
