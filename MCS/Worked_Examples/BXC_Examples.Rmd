\subsection{Diabetes (HB1Ac) data set (2008 paper)}
\citet{BXC2008} describes the sampling method when discussing a motivating example. Diabetes patients attending an outpatient clinic in Denmark have their $HbA_{1c}$ levels routinely measured at every visit. Venous and Capillary blood samples were obtained from all patients appearing at the clinic over two days. Samples were measured on four consecutive days on each machines, hence there are five analysis days.

\citet{BXC2008} notes that every machine was calibrated every day to the manufacturers guidelines. Measurements are classified by method, individual and replicate. In this case the replicates are clearly not exchangeable, neither within patients nor simulataneously for all patients.


\subsection{the Oximetry Data}
\citet{BXC2008} introduces a second data set; the oximetry study. This study done at the Royal Children's Hospital in
Melbourne to assess the agreement between co-oximetry and pulse oximetry in small babies.

In most cases, measurements were taken by both method at three different times. In some cases there are either one or two pairs of measurements, hence the data is unbalanced. \citet{BXC2008} describes many of the children as being very sick, and with very low oxygen saturations levels. Therefore it must be assumed that a biological change can occur in interim periods, and measurements are not true replicates.



\citet{BXC2008} demonstrate the necessity of accounting for linked replicated by comparing the limits of agreement from the `oximetry' data set using a model with the additional term, and one without. When the interaction is accounted for the limits of agreement are (-9.62,14.56). When the interaction is not accounted for, the limts of agreement are (-11.88,16.83). It is shown that the failure to include this additional term results in an over-estimation of the standard deviations of differences.

Roy's approach assumes that replicates are linked. Limits of agreement are determined using Roy's method, without adding any additional terms, are found to be consistent with the `interaction' model; $(-9.562, 14.504 )$.  However, following Carstensen's example, an addition interaction term is added to the implementation of Roy's model to assess the effect, the limits of agreement estimates do not change. However there is a conspicuous difference in within-subject matrices of Roy's model and the modified model (denoted $1$ and $2$ respectively);
\begin{equation}
\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{1}= \left(\begin{array}{cc}
16.61 &	11.67\\
11.67 & 27.65 \end{array}\right) \qquad
\boldsymbol{\hat{\Sigma}}_{2}= \left( \begin{array}{cc}
7.55 & 2.60 \\
2.60 & 18.59 \end{array} \right). 
\end{equation}

\noindent (The variance of the additional random effect in model $2$ is $3.01$.)

\citet{akaike} introduces the Akaike information criterion ($AIC$), a model 
selection tool based on the likelihood function. Given a data set, candidate models
are ranked according to their AIC values, with the model having the lowest AIC being considered the best fit.Two candidate models can said to be equally good if there is a difference of less than $2$ in their AIC values.

The Akaike information criterion (AIC) for both models are $AIC_{1} = 2304.226$ and $AIC_{2} = 2306.226$ , indicating little difference in models. The AIC values for the Carstensen `unlinked' and `linked' models are $1994.66$ and $1955.48$ respectively, indicating an improvement by adding the interaction term.

The $\boldsymbol{\hat{\Sigma}}$ matrices are informative as to the difference between Carstensen's unlinked and linked models. For the oximetry data, the covariance terms (given above as 11.67 and 2.6 respectively) are of similar magnitudes to the variance terms. Conversely for the `fat' data the covariance term ($-0.00032$) is negligible. When the interaction term is added to the model, the covariance term remains negligible. (For the `fat' data, the difference in AIC values is also approximately $2$).

To conclude, Carstensen's models provided a rigorous way to determine limits of agreement, but don't provide for the computation of $\boldsymbol{\hat{D}}$ and $\boldsymbol{\hat{\Sigma}}$. Therefore the test's proposed by \citet{ARoy2009} can not be implemented. Conversely, accurate limits of agreement as determined by Carstensen's model may also be found using Roy's method. Addition of the interaction term erodes the capability of Roy's approach to compare candidate models, and therefore shall not be adopted.

Finally, to complement the blood pressure (i.e.`J vs S') method comparison from the previous section (i.e.`J vs S'), the limits of agreement are $15.62 \pm 1.96 \times 20.33 = (-24.22, 55.46)$.

\citet{BXC2008} demonstrates the use of the interaction term when computing the limits of agreement for the `Oximetry' data set. When the interaction term is omitted, the limits of agreement are $(-9.97, 14.81)$. Carstensen advises the inclusion of the interaction term for linked replicates, and hence the limits of agreement are recomputed as $(-12.18,17.12)$.
