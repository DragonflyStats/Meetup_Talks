\section{Roy's PEFR Examples}


%--------------------------------------------------------------------------Example 1b  ----  JSR Data %

To complete the study, the relevant values are provided for the $R \mbox{vs} S$ comparison also.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------Example 2  ----  PEFR Data %

The second data set, a comparison of two peak expiratory flow rate measurements, is referenced by \citet{BA86}.


%--------------------------------------------------------------------------Example 3 Cardiac Ejection Fraction Data %
The last case study is also based on a data set from  \citet{BA99}. It contains the measurements of left ventricular cardiac eject fraction, measured by impedance cartography and radionuclide ventriculography, on twelve patients.
The number of replicated differs for each patient.

The bias is shown to be $0.7040$, with a p-value of $0.0204$. The MLEa of the between-method and within-method variance-covariance matrices of methods $RV$ and $IC$ are given by

\begin{equation}\hat{D}=\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
1.6323 & 1.1427 \\
1.1427 & 1.4498 \\
\end{array}
\right),
\end{equation}



\begin{equation}\hat{\Sigma}=\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
1.6323 & 1.1427 \\
1.1427 & 1.4498 \\
\end{array}
\right).
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item \citet{ARoy2009} notes that these are the same estimate for variance as given by \citet{BA99}.
	
\item The repeatability coefficients are determined to be $0.9080$ for the RV method and $1.0293$ for the IC method.
	
\item From the estimated $\boldsymbol{\Omega_{i}}$ correlation matrix, the overall correlation coefficient is $0.7100$.

\item The overall correllation coefficients between two methods RV and IC are $0.9384$ and $0.9131$ respectively.
	
\item \citet{ARoy2009} concludes that is appropriate to switch between the two methods if needed.

\item \citet{ARoy2009} recommends to not switch between the two method.
