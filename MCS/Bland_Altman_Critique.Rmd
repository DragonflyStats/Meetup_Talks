\citet{BA83} highlighted the capability of the Bland-Altman plot as a diagnostic tool.
Several scenarios are given.


The authors make a point of advocating the use of the identity plot in both citet{BA83} and citet{BA86}.

A primary reason that the authors give is that the Bland-Altman plot would leave less blank space on the page. 

For any realistic method comparison problem, the covariates would congregate around the line of equality to some extent, whereas the 
covariates would be more dispersed around the Bland-Altman plot.

The Bland-Altman plot is likened to the conventional residual plots from standard regression analysis, and the approach to interpretating such plots is
similar.

Phenomena that such residual plots are used to detect (i.e. heteroscedascity, curvilinearity) should usually be evident in the original scatterplots. 

The limits of agreement are a univariate method, based on case-wise differnece only, and can be reported independently to the Bland-Altman plot.

In short, the justification to replace conventional bivariate approaches (i.e. the scatterplot) with variants (i.e. the Bland-Altman plot) is insufficient.

Once the Bland-Altman The case-wise average rarely serve any critical function. citet{BA99} offers a regression based technique, but fails to demonstrate why such a technique would
be an improvement on traditional regression models on the underlying data.
