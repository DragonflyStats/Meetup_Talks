\subsection{Bi-plot Display of PCA}

*  Bi-plot display is a visualization technique for investigating
the inter-relationships between the observations and
variables in multivariate data.
*   To display a bi-plot, the data should be considered as a
matrix, in which the column represents the variable space
while the row represents the observational space.
*   The term bi-plot means it is a plot of two dimensions with the
observation and variable spaces plotted simultaneously.
*   In PCA, relationships between PC scores and PCA loadings
associated with any two PCs can be illustrated in a bi-plot
display
