\section{Euclidean Distance}
The Euclidean distance between two points, x and y, with $k$ dimensions is calculated as:
\[ \sqrt{ \sum^{k}_{j=1} ( x_j - y_j)^2 } \]
The Euclidean distance is always greater than or equal to zero. The measurement would be zero for identical points and high for points that show little similarity.

\subsection{Example}
Compute the Euclidean Distance between the following points:
$X = \{1,5,4,3\}$ and $Y = \{2,1,8,7\}$

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
$x_j$	&	$y_j$	&   $x_j - y_j$	&	$(x_j - y_j)^2$	\\ \hline
1	&	2	&	-1	&	1	\\
5	&	1	&	4	&	16	\\
4	&	8	&	-4	&	16	\\
3	&	7	&	-4	&	16	\\ \hline
	&		&		&	49	\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The Euclidean Distance between the two points is $\sqrt{49}$ i.e. 7.

\subsection{Squared Euclidean Distance}
The Squared Euclidean distance between two points, x and y, with $k$ dimensions is calculated as:
\[ \sum^{k}_{j=1} ( x_j - y_j)^2  \]
The Squared Euclidean distance may be preferred to the Euclidean distance as it is slightly less computational complex, without loss of any information.
