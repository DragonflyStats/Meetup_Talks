These data are taken from the British Election Study 2005 pre-campaign and
post-election panel data. We will consider the propensity to vote (sometimes called turnout) as the
dependent variable, which has 2 categories. 
out to vote.

*  The odds of a male turning out to vote are:
\[1346/491 = 2.741\]
*  The odds of female turning out to vote are
\[1729/587 = 2.945\]
*  The Odds ratio (female: male) are
\[ \frac{1729/587 }{ 1346/491 } = \frac{2.945}{2.741}= 1.074\]

\section*{Question 5: Logistic Transformation}

*  
Given that $p_i = 0.2$, compute $\eta_i$.

\[ \eta_i = \log \left( \frac{0.2}{1-0.2} \right)= \log\left( \frac{0.2}{0.8} \right)\] 

\[ \eta_i =  \mbox{log}(0.25) =-1.386 \]

*  Given that $\eta_i = 2.3$, compute $p_i$.
\[ \pi_i  =  \frac{e^{2.3}}{1 + e^{2.3}} = \frac{9.974}{1 + 9.974} = 0.908 \]

\section*{Question 7: Wald Test}
\noindent
For the logistic regression model described in the SPSS output below, state the Odds Ratio for each variable. State the 95\% confidence interval for the Odds Ratio in each case. Comment on this significance of each predictor variable.
